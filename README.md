This repository contains research-grade code used to produce results for the migraine project.

The `src` directory contains three files:

- `migraine_main.R`, which calls the other two files

- `migraine_functions.R`

- `utils.R`

The data and generated results are not included in this repository. However, you can use these scripts with your own data to reproduce analogous analyses and results.
